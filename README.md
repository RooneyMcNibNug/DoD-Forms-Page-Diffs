# Tracking pages changes on the Department of Defense Forms Management Program pages

A git scraper designed to grab the latest changes from the source code of all DoD Forms Management index pages:

This includes the nice tables they have set with Number, Title, Edition Date, and OPR columns.

The cron in the scraper config is currently set to check daily for changes.

I thought this might be useful for FOIA folx as well as more generally tracking the changes on these directives for more automated transparency.
